# BlackJack

Description:
A blackjack card game made to represent how a List ADT works. It will have a cards with different ranks and suits and these cards will be
put into piles which can represent a deck or a player's hand or the cards on the table. I am also hoping to make a graphic interface for
it have the cards be displayed using the similar function I used in my HighLow card game project. The project will be deemed a success if
a user can play the game as many times as they want with all the standard blackjack rules applying.

Rules:
The goal of the game is to beat the dealer and the other players hands while not having your hand go over a total value of 21. All face cards
have a value of 10 and aces can be either a 1 or an 11. The user has to options: hit or stay. Hit being the command which gives them another
card. If the user has two of the same value card, the user can also have the option to split the cards into two seperate piles and eventually
play with one of them.
